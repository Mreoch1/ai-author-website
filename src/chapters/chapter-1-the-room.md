# Chapter 1: The Room

**Time:** 2:15 PM - 3:00 PM

---

The door seals behind them like a prison gate. Overhead, one fluorescent tube flickers with the rhythm of a dying heartbeat. The air is just a degree too warm, the result of a busted HVAC system and two government-issued box fans that do little more than shuffle the stale air.

A plastic water cooler gurgles softly in the corner, its jug half-empty already. The room smells of old coffee and institutional disinfectant, with an undertone of something else—fear, perhaps, or the accumulated anxiety of countless deliberations that have taken place within these beige walls.

Twelve people who are no longer strangers—not after three weeks locked away together in the Marriott downtown, shepherded between hotel and courthouse like prisoners themselves. Each carries the weight of Marcus Williams's future. But they also carry the tensions of forced proximity and sleepless nights, each alone in identical hotel rooms, wrestling with their conscience.

Diane Washington adjusts her blazer and surveys the room with the practiced eye of someone accustomed to taking charge. At forty-two, she has spent two decades climbing corporate ladders, and she recognizes the dynamics at play here—though weeks of sequestration have made these dynamics infinitely more complex. Alliances have formed over room service dinners. Resentments have festered over stolen newspaper sections and elevator small talk.

"Well," she says, her voice cutting through the uncomfortable silence, "I suppose we should begin."

"Begin what?" Carmen Rodriguez's voice carries the weight of experience. "Begin deciding if we're going to bury a nineteen-year-old kid in concrete for the rest of his life?"

"Begin following the law," Frank Kowalski counters, his prosthetic hand clenching. "Begin doing what we swore to do."

"The law." Carmen lets out a bitter laugh. "You mean the same law that put my son in handcuffs for walking home from school? That law?"

"We're not here to relitigate the entire criminal justice system—" Alexander Reed starts, his Patek Philippe catching the light.

"No?" Zara Johnson's voice cuts through, sharp as a razor. "Then why are we here? Because from where I'm sitting, that's exactly what we're doing. Every time a Black teenager ends up in that defendant's chair, we're putting the whole damn system on trial."

Ruth Goldstein's wire-rimmed glasses catch the fluorescent light as she speaks, her voice soft but carrying. "Perhaps we're here to prove the system can work. If we let it."

The others arrange themselves around the table, their seating choices reflecting three weeks of alliances and animosities. Kevin Chen slides in beside Ruth—their unlikely friendship forged over shared complaints about the hotel's terrible Wi-Fi. Sofia Restrepo takes the seat closest to where a window should be, as if seeking escape routes that don't exist. A small pride flag pin on her blazer lapel catches the light—a quiet statement in a room full of loud opinions.

Tommy Castellano settles heavily in his chair, his bulk seeming to take up more space than it should. "Back home, you don't start 'family business' without some whiskey and a basement table. And maybe a few guys you trust." His grin fades at the silence that follows. "Tough room."

"This isn't a joke, Tommy," Sofia says, her teacher's patience fraying. "And it's not a scene from The Godfather."

"No?" His voice hardens. "Because from where I'm sitting, it looks exactly like that. Twelve people in a room, deciding someone's fate. Only difference is, we're doing it legal."

"First order of business," Diane cuts in, her corporate training kicking in, "we need to elect a foreperson."

"You seem to have already elected yourself," Tommy mutters. "Just like you've been running the show since day one."

"This ain't another corporate restructuring project, Diane," Carmen says, absently touching the scar above her left eyebrow. "This is a kid's life. A real life. Not something you get to bullet-point on your next promotion."

"We all know what's at stake, Carmen. But without order, this turns into chaos—and nobody wins." Sarah Beth's fingers traced the Bible's worn edges.

"Order?" Zara's laugh is sharp enough to cut. "Is that what you call it when a cop decides a Black teenager doesn't belong somewhere? Order?"

The room falls silent. Carmen's earlier words hang in the air like smoke, acrid and inescapable. This isn't about profit margins or market share. This is about Marcus Williams, nineteen years old, sitting in a cell somewhere, waiting for twelve people who know each other's coffee preferences and morning routines to decide whether he'll spend the rest of his life in prison.

"All in favor of Diane as foreperson?" Ruth asks, her voice carrying the weight of eight decades of watching people make impossible decisions.

Hands rise around the table—some quickly, others with visible reluctance. It's not unanimous, but it's enough.

"Thank you," Diane says, reaching for the jury instructions. "Now, before we take any votes, let's be clear about what we're deciding. The People of the State of New York versus Marcus Williams. Murder in the Second Degree in the death of Police Officer David Brennan."

"Say his name again," Frank says, his voice tight. "Officer David Brennan. Because some of us seem to have forgotten there are two people in this story."

"Nobody forgot, Frank. We just remember different things." Carmen's words landed like stones in still water.

"Write 'guilty' or 'not guilty'—no names," Diane says, tearing paper from a legal pad. "Let's see where we stand."

The scratching of pens filled the silence. Kevin stared at his blank slip, pen hovering. His brain wanted numbers, probabilities—not a yes or no that could cage a kid forever. Frank wrote "GUILTY" in block letters, each stroke carrying the weight of conviction. Sofia's pen hovered, caught between evidence and instinct.

"Seven guilty," Diane announced after collecting the folded slips. "Four not guilty. One undecided."

The room went still. Not even the water cooler gurgled.

The numbers hit them like a physical force. Seven to four to one. Not the unanimous verdict required for conviction, but close enough to suggest this wouldn't be quick. Twelve people, twelve perspectives, and only one path forward: they must reach unanimous agreement, or Marcus Williams faced a mistrial and another jury, another roll of the dice with his future. More months in detention, waiting for a new trial, adding to the year he's already spent behind bars.

The flickering fluorescent light above pulsed faster now, as if counting down to a verdict none of them were ready to give.

# Prologue: Blood Money

The diamond mine outside Koidu, Sierra Leone, had been running illegally for six months—about five months longer than most operations survived in this part of West Africa.

Viktor Kozlov crouched in the elephant grass at the edge of the mining compound, studying the layout through night vision goggles. The longevity of this particular operation had less to do with luck than with the quality of security provided by Kodiak Security Solutions, a Pentagon contractor that specialized in what their corporate literature euphemistically called "asset protection in challenging environments."

What Kozlov actually specialized in was killing people who got in the way of profit margins. At forty-three, the former Russian Spetsnaz operative had been killing people professionally for over two decades, first for the Motherland, then for various causes, and finally for whoever paid the most. Tonight, he was being paid very well indeed by his American employers to clean up what they termed "a personnel security issue."

The issue was that the mine workers had started asking inconvenient questions about where the diamonds were going, and more problematically, one worker had begun secretly documenting the operation. Joseph Kamara had been gathering evidence for weeks, hoping to expose the illegal mining operation to international authorities. Joseph remembered an American soldier he'd worked with years ago during peacekeeping operations—Sergeant Jake Brennan, who had given him contact information and said if he ever needed help with crimes involving Americans, he could reach out. When he overheard Kozlov's team planning the attack on their radio frequency, he'd tried to warn the others, but the night shift supervisor was one of Kodiak's local collaborators. Joseph had managed to send his evidence to Brennan before hiding, but it was too late to save his colleagues.

Kozlov keyed his throat mic. "Kodiak One to all Kodiak elements. Target site is green. Count fifteen local nationals in the compound, three in the guard tower, two at the equipment shed. Rules of engagement are weapons free." That meant what it always meant: shoot first, confirm later. "No witnesses, no survivors, no evidence. Copy?"

The responses came back crisp and professional from his five-man team, all former U.S. military who'd found the private sector more lucrative than serving their country. They were good soldiers, Kozlov admitted—even if they lacked the ideological purity that had once driven him. His contractors, he'd learned, were remarkably pragmatic about violence when the price was right.

"Execute in thirty seconds," Kozlov whispered.

The attack was swift, professional, and utterly one-sided. The mine workers, exhausted from a fourteen-hour shift, had no chance against military-trained operators using suppressed weapons and night vision equipment. Within three minutes, the compound was silent except for the distant hum of the diesel generators that powered the mining equipment.

Kozlov moved through the compound methodically, checking bodies with the casual efficiency of a man inspecting his work. The operation had gone perfectly, which meant his American employers would be pleased. They paid well for perfection, and they paid even better for silence.

He was examining the contents of the mine office when he heard it – a soft scraping sound from behind the equipment shed. Kozlov froze, then moved silently toward the sound, his AK-74 ready.

A young man, perhaps twenty-five, was crawling toward the tree line, leaving a dark trail in the red earth. He wore a Liverpool football jersey and a rubber bracelet that read "Hope." He'd been shot in the leg and was trying to escape into the jungle. In his hand, Kozlov could see the distinctive blue glow of a cell phone screen. The bastard had been recording during the attack.

"Kodiak Two," Kozlov called softly into his mic. "We have a runner."

"Copy, Kodiak One. Want me to take him?"

"Negative. I've got him."

Kozlov approached the wounded man, who looked up with eyes wide with terror and pain. He was young, probably someone's son, maybe someone's husband. Under different circumstances, Kozlov might have felt something resembling sympathy. Tonight, he felt only the mild annoyance of a professional who'd discovered a flaw in an otherwise perfect operation.

The young man said something in the local dialect, probably pleading for his life. Kozlov didn't speak the language, but desperation sounded the same in every tongue.

"Sorry, friend," Kozlov said in English. He wasn't particularly sorry. "Nothing personal."

He raised his rifle, then paused. The cell phone in the young man's hand was still glowing. On the screen, Kozlov could see what appeared to be a video file from the phone's gallery. The young man had been documenting their operations.

This was a problem.

Kozlov knelt beside the wounded man and examined the phone. There were dozens of photos and videos stored on the device – images of American equipment, American weapons, and most damaging of all, clear photographs of Kozlov and his team from previous visits to the compound. Joseph had been documenting the illegal operations for weeks.

"Kodiak One to Control," he said into his radio, using the call sign for his Stateside handler. "We have a complication."

The response came back immediately in the flat, bureaucratic tone that Kozlov had learned to associate with mid-level Pentagon officials: "Define complication."

"Digital evidence. Photos and video of our previous operations. Already transmitted to U.S. federal agents."

There was a long pause. Then: "Clean it up. All of it. Whatever it takes."

"Copy that." He hated leaving a job unfinished, but the voice on the other end wasn't asking.

Kozlov looked down at the wounded man, who was still clutching his phone with desperate hope. The young man probably thought the device represented salvation – evidence that would bring justice for his murdered colleagues. He had no way of knowing that in the modern world, digital evidence was often more dangerous to those who possessed it than to those it was meant to expose.

"What's your name?" Kozlov asked in English.

The young man stared at him, uncomprehending.

Kozlov tried French, which was sometimes spoken in this part of West Africa. "Comment vous appelez-vous?"

"Joseph," the young man whispered. "Joseph Kamara."

"Well, Joseph Kamara," Kozlov said, switching back to English, "you've just created a very expensive problem for some very important people. They're going to want me to track down everyone you sent those photos to."

Joseph's eyes widened as he understood the implication.

"Here's the thing," Kozlov continued, almost conversationally. "I'm not entirely without conscience. So I'm going to make you a deal. Tell me who else has seen these photos, and I'll make sure they die quickly. Clean, professional."

Joseph said something in his local language, probably a prayer.

"Or you can say nothing, and I'll find them the hard way. Which means they'll die slowly, probably after watching their children die first."

Your choice.

The young man looked at him with a mixture of terror and defiance that Kozlov recognized. He'd seen it in the eyes of Afghan mujahideen, Chechen separatists, and various other enemies of various other states. It was the look of someone who knew they were going to die but refused to make it easy for their killer.

"Américain," Joseph whispered in broken French. "J'ai envoyé... à Américain."

Kozlov felt a cold knot form in his stomach. His French was rusty but functional. "Quel Américain?"

"Homme du gouvernement." Joseph's breathing was becoming labored, but his eyes remained focused. "J'ai tout envoyé. Noms, visages, locations. Tout."

"Tu mens."

Joseph managed a weak smile. "Regarde téléphone. Email envoyé... quand j'ai entendu la radio."

Kozlov grabbed the phone and scrolled through the sent messages. His blood ran cold as he read the recipient addresses. The first email had been sent thirty minutes ago to Jake.Brennan@ci.irs.gov—"Sergeant Brennan - It is Joseph Kamara from Freetown peacekeeping 2018. You said contact you if Americans commit crimes. I have evidence of American company threatening workers and stealing diamonds at mine. Je send photos and video. Please help. Ils viennent pour moi maintenant."

The second email had been sent just ten minutes ago to the same address: "Sergeant Brennan - They are killing everyone. Video attached. Please remember me. Joseph."

"Blyad'," he muttered—a Russian profanity that would have made his grandmother cross herself.

He keyed his radio again. "Control, we have a bigger problem."

"Define bigger."

"Evidence has been transmitted to federal personnel. Someone claiming to be IRS Criminal Investigation Division."

The pause this time was even longer. When the voice came back, it carried a different tone – one that suggested the speaker was no longer a mid-level bureaucrat but someone with considerably more authority.

"Kodiak One, you are to return to base immediately. Mission parameters have changed. We're going to need a different kind of cleanup."

"Copy that." Kozlov looked down at Joseph, who was watching him with dying eyes. "What about the local situation?"

"Handle it."

Kozlov ended the radio call and looked at Joseph Kamara, who was still clutching his phone like a talisman. The young man had probably thought he was striking a blow for justice, exposing the truth about what was happening in his country. He had no way of knowing that he'd just signed the death warrant of an IRS agent in New York who was probably sitting in some suburban office, completely unaware that he'd become a target in a war he didn't even know existed.

"You know what the funny thing is, Joseph?" Kozlov said, raising his rifle. "You probably just got more people killed than if you'd kept your mouth shut. Justice has a body count."

Joseph Kamara died still clutching his phone, still believing that somewhere in America, someone would see his evidence and care enough to seek justice for a group of murdered diamond miners in Sierra Leone.

He was right about someone seeing the evidence.

He was wrong about the justice part.

Three thousand miles away, in a secure facility outside Washington, D.C., a different kind of cleanup was already being planned. One that would reach from the diamond mines of West Africa to the suburbs of Long Island.

Viktor Kozlov had a body to dispose of and a flight to catch. He didn't believe in causes anymore. Just contracts. As he walked away from Joseph Kamara's body, he was already planning his next operation—more subtle, more complex, and ultimately more important to his American controllers.

After all, killing African diamond miners was just business.

Killing federal agents was patriotic duty.

At least, that's how they would explain it when he landed at JFK Airport in eighteen hours, carrying diplomatic credentials and a target list that would keep him busy for weeks.

The first name on that list was Special Agent Jake Brennan, IRS Criminal Investigation Division, Hauppauge, New York.

Brennan had just inherited Joseph Kamara's problem.

And Viktor Kozlov didn't just solve problems. He erased them.

IRS agent Jake Brennan, assigned to investigate Hawthorne Defense Solutions as part of a coordinated congressional oversight operation, receives urgent evidence from Joseph Kamara, a former contact from his peacekeeping days in Sierra Leone. Joseph's video documentation proves what congressional investigators suspectedâ€”that Hawthorne's subsidiary Kodiak Security is committing massacres while stealing conflict diamonds. When Russian mercenary Viktor Kozlov arrives to eliminate witnesses, Brennan partners with congressional investigator Sarah Reeves to expose the conspiracy publicly before Viktor's noon deadline. Racing against time and institutional betrayal, they must risk everything to ensure Joseph's sacrifice leads to justice.
